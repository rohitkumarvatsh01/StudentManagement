# Student Management System with CRUD Operations using Spring Boot
This project showcases the implementation of a Student Management System using Spring Boot, providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to efficiently manage student records.

# Key functionalities include:
<li><b>Create Record:</b> Add a new student record to the database.</li>
<li><b>Get All Records:</b> Retrieve all student records from the database.</li>
<li><b>Get One Record:</b> Retrieve a specific student record by providing the student roll number.</li>
<li><b>Update Record:</b> Update an existing student record in the database.</li>
<li><b>Delete One Record:</b> Delete a specific student record by providing the student roll number.</li>
<li><b>Delete All Records:</b> Delete all student records from the database.</li>
 
# Project Structure
The project follows a Spring Boot architecture, organized into a RESTful API with the StudentController managing CRUD operations. The underlying data is stored and retrieved using the StudentRepository.
